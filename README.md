CS 250 Final Project: Sprint Review and Retrospective
Artifact Overview
This repository contains the Sprint Review and Retrospective deliverable from my CS 250 course. This document showcases my understanding and application of Agile and Scrum methodologies, focusing on iterative development, teamwork, and project improvement. It reflects the work done throughout the course and demonstrates my ability to adapt Agile practices to real-world scenarios.

Reflection Questions
1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs starts with actively listening to stakeholders and understanding their goals. I use user stories to break down these needs into clear, actionable tasks that align with the user’s perspective. This approach ensures that the program delivers value and remains focused on addressing the users’ key requirements. For example, during this project, user stories guided our sprint planning and helped prioritize tasks effectively.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach program development as an iterative process, where each sprint delivers incremental value. Agile processes like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives help me stay organized and adapt to challenges. In the future, I aim to continue using these practices to ensure flexibility, promote collaboration, and deliver high-quality software. Incorporating feedback loops and maintaining a prioritized backlog will be critical for my success.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member involves effective communication, collaboration, and accountability. This means actively participating in discussions, providing constructive feedback, and respecting diverse perspectives. During this project, I focused on fostering a positive team environment by supporting my teammates, addressing challenges collaboratively, and remaining adaptable. A good team member also prioritizes the team’s goals over individual success, ensuring the project’s overall success.
